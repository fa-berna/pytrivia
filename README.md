## How to run the code
1. Clone the repository
2. Either:
    a) manually install all the libraries needed and listed in ``requirements.txt`` via the PIP (you can automate 
    this by running ``pip install -r requirements.txt``) 
    b) setup a virtual environment via `python3 -m venv venv/`, run the command to activate the virtual environment
     (in Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`) and then install the packages in the virtual environment via 
     ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
3. Run the game by running the ``run_game.py`` file (if you used a virutal environment in 2, make sure it is active 
for this step to work).
